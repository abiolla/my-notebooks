# Loan Approval Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting loan approval status using various applicant features. 
The project explores data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building using logistic regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Project Overview

- Data importing and description  
- Handling missing data  
- Encoding categorical variables   
- Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy  
- Analyze feature importance using Random Forest  
- Perform error analysis on false negatives to understand model limitations

## Files

- `loan_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code and analysis  
- `loan_dataset.csv`:  This is the Excel file containing the dataset used in the analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
